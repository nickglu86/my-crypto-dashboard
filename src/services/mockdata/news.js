        "content": ", known for its expertise in off-chain trading, just released the , a Layer 3 trading platform that integrates multiple off-chain protocols to enable trustless, cost-effective and near-instant cross-chain trading. The Hydranet DEX made its official debut as a mainnet beta on September 23, 2023, following more than a year of dedicated development. The release signifies a major milestone in the project’s history, whose future promises even more groundbreaking developments. I am really proud of us. We have evolved from a small project to a currently #700 mature DeFi project with a great 2023/24 roadmap ahead. – Joe Park, project manager of Hydranet Hydranet presents their DEX as a Layer 3 trading platform that connects the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems (including all off-chain compatible Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) networks), allowing users to trade seamlessly between them. By their use of off-chain protocols, such as the Lightning and Connext Vector technologies, crafted into a single solution that allows these protocols to interact, Hydranet has made it possible to trade between fundamentally different blockchains with virtually no fees, near-instantly, and, most importantly, in a trustless manner, as users will always retain full control of their funds. Off-chain protocols play a pivotal role in this solution and refer to a set of rules, specifications, and frameworks that define the standards and procedures for conducting transactions outside the blockchain using what is commonly known as state channels. Unlike on-chain transactions, which necessitate miners’ confirmations, off-chain transactions are distinguished by their instant transaction times, minimal-to-no transaction fees, high level of privacy and trustless operations. These attributes make off-chain transactions particularly useful for microtransactions, frequent interactions, and scenarios where real-time responsiveness is crucial. Recognizing the benefits of off-chain protocols, Hydranet has undoubtedly taken advantage of them in creating a solution that will meet the long-standing demand for a cost-effective trading platform capable of bridging fundamentally different blockchains without compromising security, integrity, and scalability. This trading platform is now available as a downloadable desktop client from Hydranet’s . The platform comprises a self-custodial wallet, a state channel management interface, and an order book for trading on its Layer 3 exchange. Trades on the exchange are secured using Hashed TimeLock Contracts (HTLC) which guarantees that they are completed in accordance with what is agreed upon, or not completed at all if either one of the trading parties attempts to manipulate the trade. Below is a video showcasing a mainnet Bitcoin to Ethereum trade using the latest version of the Hydranet DEX. The Hydranet DEX is currently hosting a set of four trading pairs to start off with: These trading pairs effectively bridge the Bitcoin, Ethereum and Arbitrum (denoted as ‘a’) blockchains and highlight the capabilities of the trading platform. Adding support for other trading pairs and networks is said to be as easy as adding a few lines of code. With all the excitement surrounding this new type of trading platform and how it will develop in the future, Hydranet emphasizes that this is only the beginning of the Hydranet DEX cross-chain future and more news is coming.

However, prior to this downturn, IMX had been on an upward trajectory, by 35%. This surge was largely attributed to the accumulation of IMX tokens by whales, facilitated by Arrington Capital. At present, IMX is managing to maintain its position above the $0.58 support zone, making strides towards a resistance level of $0.62.

Base, an L2 network launched by Coinbase, announced that there are . With a TVL of $543 million, it accounts for about 5.23% of the L2 network market share. According to L2Beat, on September 17th, two Ethereum L2 networks, Base and zkSync Era, surpassed Ethereum in TPS. Base reached 12.93, a 49.76% increase in the past 7 days, and zkSync Era reached 12.62. In a recent hearing, the judge encouraged the SEC and Binance US to cooperate. The SEC was requested to narrow its information requests, while Binance was asked to provide additional information on custody solutions. In the world of cryptocurrency, there are always new developments and updates to keep up with. Here are some of the other last week news highlights: In a recent statement, Chairman Powell announced that the Federal Reserve has chosen to keep interest rates unchanged. This decision comes amidst a backdrop of high inflation, which has posed challenges, particularly for individuals with limited financial means. Since the beginning of last year, the policy interest rate has been raised by 5-1/4 percentage points, bringing it to the current range of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) remains committed to achieving the 2% inflation target and will adjust policies based on economic data and prevailing conditions. Looking ahead, the projected interest rate is expected to reach 5.6% by the end of this year, suggesting a potential for one more increase. By the end of 2024, the rate is anticipated to decrease gradually to 5.1%, signaling a shift in policy direction. Normal operations are projected to resume in 2025, with the interest rate estimated to be 3.9%. The current interest rate is far higher than the neutral policy estimate, indicating that no further increases are probable. This is important to note. Nevertheless, the committee will remain cautious and take into account any new facts or chances. If necessary, they are prepared to raise interest rates even further. In November, the final judgment regarding any potential increases will be made, taking into account the impact of inflation as well as changing economic conditions. The cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing a period of frustration, with sideways movement and poor liquidity. There seems to be no significant reason for a strong market pump at the moment. Since the FTX crash, trading volume in the market has been extremely weak and continues to trend downwards. Not only that, but trading volume on CEX exchanges and website traffic are also decreasing. Considering these circumstances, it is advisable not to engage in trading activities at this time. Instead, a prudent strategy would be to accumulate and hold onto coins with the expectation of an uptrend in the future. During the recent 2049 token event in Singapore, several positive trends and valuable information about the crypto industry emerged. These include the rise of RWA (real-world assets) and the increasing prominence of assets on-chain and stablecoins. Additionally, advancements in Layer 1 (L1), Layer 2 (L2), and zk (zero-knowledge) technology were discussed. Furthermore, regulations in Asia are becoming more favorable towards blockchain, and numerous crypto payment companies are launching, necessitating compliance and anti-money laundering measures. In a significant development, a list of asset managers who have registered for immediate delivery was revealed. This list includes prominent names such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco Galaxy, Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, VanEck, GlobalX, ARK Invest, Valkyrie, and Bitwise. Collectively, these asset managers have a staggering $17.7 trillion USD of assets under management. This suggests that the future growth of Bitcoin (BTC) may mirror that of gold. Turning our attention to Layer 2 solutions, there is exciting news for Arbitrum. They have launched a $50 million incentive program to support projects on Arbitrum, along with the Arbitrum Odyssey campaign, which rewards participants with $Arb tokens for completing tasks within ecosystem projects. In this ecosystem, several notable tokens are worth mentioning, including $ARB, $GRAIL, $RDNT, $GMX, $WINR, $HMX, $DMT, and $PENDLE. This collection of information provides valuable insights into the current state of the cryptocurrency market and its future prospects. It is essential for investors and enthusiasts to stay informed and make well-informed decisions based on these developments.",

The recent recovery in the CRV token’s value can be attributed to renewed interest in the asset after the , which had a ripple effect on DeFi protocols. It’s worth noting that in the previous month, Egorov had borrowed over $100 million in stablecoins across various DeFi lending platforms, using his CRV holdings as collateral. Instead of selling his CRV directly, Egorov opted for this approach, which drew criticism from the crypto community. Reports also surfaced about his extravagant expenditures on multi-million-dollar mansions in Australia.

        "content": "The AA Wallet Adoption Surge According to SixdegreeLab’s on ERC-4337 account abstraction, the numbers tell a compelling story. Six months after its launch, more than 687,000 AA wallets emerged across multiple chains, sparking over 2 million user operations. However, a fascinating twist lies within these statistics. An astounding 88.24% of AA wallets saw usage limited to five times or less, with most being employed for basic tasks like transferring assets or minting NFTs. Profitability Challenges for Bundlers Amidst the fray, approximately 15,000 Bundlers stood out as crucial elements in packaging and processing user operations, with Pimlico reigning supreme in market share. One standout revelation is Alchemy, which amassed an unprecedented revenue of approximately US$20,000. Astonishingly, 97.18% of bundled transactions contained only a single user operation, leaving around 90% of Bundlers unprofitable. On the flip side, 117 Paymasters gallantly bore the torch by covering users’ gas fees, accumulating a staggering total of US$465,000. Pimlico carved out a lion’s share, capturing 43.45% of this substantial sum. Among the accounts, 62.63% opted for Wallet Factory deployment through ZeroDev. Interestingly, the LEGO method emerged as the most preferred approach for constructing AA wallets, leveraging the Bundler, Paymaster, and Wallet Factory components from different third-party providers.",
