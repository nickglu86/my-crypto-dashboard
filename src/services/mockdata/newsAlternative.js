      "content": "FTX lawyers seek a $243.7 million clawback from Embed insiders and executives, alleging overpayment for the stock-trading platform by former leadership. FTX’s current leadership is pursuing legal action to recover over $240 million from insiders and executives who allegedly benefited from the overpriced acquisition of stock-clearing platform Embed in September. According to a report by Cointelegraph on May 18, a lawsuit was filed on May 17 against former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and other top FTX insiders. The lawsuit claims that the acquisition of Embed lacked sufficient due diligence. Simultaneously, another lawsuit was filed on the same day, seeking to reclaim funds from Embed CEO Michael Giles and its shareholders. This lawsuit alleges that FTX paid an excessively inflated price of $220 million for the stock-trading platform. According to the official filing, FTX’s acquisition of Embed left Embed’s chief technology officer, Laurence Beal, astonished at the high price paid by FTX, especially considering the brief meeting with Giles. Beal expressed his surprise in a conversation with another senior employee at Embed, using a cowboy emoji to describe FTX’s due diligence process. As part of the acquisition, FTX provided retention bonuses totaling $70 million to Embed’s employees. Most of this amount, $55 million, was given to Giles, who later became concerned about justifying this significant sum to the rest of the employees. Between the day Giles signed the acquisition agreement on June 10, 2022, and the closing of the deal on September 30, 2022, he received an astonishing $490,000 per day, assuming he worked seven days a week. Furthermore, when the acquisition was completed, Giles was granted an additional $103 million because of his status as Embed’s largest shareholder. Giles, as Embed’s CEO, received his full retention bonus immediately. Other employees had to wait for two years to receive their full bonuses. FTX is seeking a clawback of $236.8 million from Giles and Embed executives. Embed’s smaller shareholders will also face a clawback of $6.9 million. Lawyers accuse FTX insiders of exploiting inadequate controls and recordkeeping. They allegedly used misallocated funds for the Embed acquisition. FTX insiders were reportedly aware of FTX’s insolvency during the deal. Chapter 11 bankruptcy for FTX was filed on November 11, 2022. The new leadership, led by John Ray III, aims to recover funds for customers and creditors. FTX lawyers are considering relaunching the exchange. A class action lawsuit against celebrities endorsing FTX is backed by former executive Daniel Friedberg, the ex-compliance chief. FTX, once valued at $32 billion, filed for bankruptcy last November, customers withdrew funds as concerns arose and the missing funds were discovered. They linked mismanagement and risky investments to Alameda, the affiliated hedge fund. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried, formerly a crypto industry star, faces criminal charges. Former FTX and Alameda leaders have pleaded guilty. New management is investigating and trying to recover funds. The implications for over a million creditors are unclear.",

      "content": "Dan O’Prey, Chief Product Officer at Bakkt, recently discussed these positive developments and shed light on the company’s plans for retail expansion during an interview with Cointelegraph’s U.S. News Editor, Sam Bourgi, at the Bitcoin 2023 event. In a conversation with Sam Bourgi, Dan O’Prey discussed the positive long-term trends in the global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency. He also mentioned the company’s plans for expanding its retail operations overseas. Over the past two years, Bakkt has prioritized its role as a “B2B2C” firm, witnessing a significant level of institutional interest focused on Bitcoin, despite the repercussions of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange collapse. O’Prey emphasized that Bitcoin’s reputation has suffered due to issues and controversies surrounding other companies, practices, and cryptocurrencies within the industry, even though those were unrelated to Bitcoin itself. While Bitcoin has benefited from the regulatory ambiguity in the United States, which established its status as a commodity, the lack of regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies in general remains a significant hurdle for broader Bitcoin adoption. O’Prey acknowledged this challenge and noted that the recent events have underscored the importance of implementing robust practices in the industry, despite the slower pace of progress in doing so. Bakkt currently operates its retail platform exclusively within the United States, focusing on embedded trading, payouts, and rewards. However, the company has ambitious plans to expand its retail activities internationally. O’Prey explained that Bakkt is collaborating with its partners to identify jurisdictions where they already engage in equities trading or are interested in adding cryptocurrency services. O’Prey commended the European Union’s recent introduction of the Markets in Crypto-Assets regulations, highlighting the value of regulatory clarity. He emphasized that such clarity enables individuals and businesses to understand the operational and compliance requirements, ultimately fostering increased participation from institutions and attracting talent, capital, and job opportunities to regions that embrace crypto-friendly regulations. The interview shed light on the positive trajectory of cryptocurrency regulation globally, Bakkt’s strategic focus on institutional and retail markets, and the company’s aspirations to expand its retail presence beyond the United States. Bakkt reported a net loss of approximately $45 million in the first quarter. However, the company anticipates that its recent acquisition of Apex Crypto will contribute to its future profitability. The acquisition, which was completed on April 1, is aimed at integrating Apex Crypto’s business swiftly. During a webinar, Bakkt CEO Gavin Michael emphasized that the deal will accelerate the introduction of new crypto capabilities, strengthen the company’s path to profitability, and provide access to highly skilled employees in product engineering and operations. Karen Alexander, Bakkt’s Chief Financial Officer, attributed the lower-than-expected net revenue of $13 million in the first quarter to volume-based service revenue. She highlighted the impact of activity levels at the customer call center and ongoing technology development work conducted on behalf of clients. Alexander expressed optimism regarding the contribution of Apex Crypto’s financial results for the remainder of 2023, expecting them to bring Bakkt closer to achieving free cash flow breakeven in combination with the company’s overall performance. The acquisition of Apex Crypto was agreed upon in November, and it allows Bakkt to expand its crypto offerings to corporate clients. Bakkt’s association with Apex Crypto has facilitated partnerships with leading platforms such as Webull, Stash, and Public.com. This shift in focus has seen Bakkt prioritize delivering crypto capabilities to its partners rather than directly targeting end consumers. By operating behind the scenes, Bakkt aims to create an optimal trading experience for clients, replicating a model that has proven successful. In line with its regular coin listing review process, Bakkt recently made the decision to delist at least 25 coins. This move was primarily driven by the rapidly evolving regulatory landscape in the United States, with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s enforcement action against Bittrex serving as a significant factor. While delisting 25 coins may appear substantial, Bakkt generates the majority of its revenue from coins with larger market capitalization, such as Bitcoin. Despite the regulatory uncertainties, Bakkt remains committed to offering a range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Cardano, Solana, Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, Ethereum Classic, Polygon, Shiba Inu, and USD Coin. Looking ahead, Bakkt intends to expand its presence in additional markets, including the United Kingdom, parts of the European Union, and Southeast Asia. The CEO, Gavin Michael, highlighted the progress being made in these regions in terms of crypto legislation and the existing presence of Bakkt’s clients, which would facilitate market entry. Crypto custody serves as a cornerstone product for Bakkt, and the company places great importance on enhancing its custody offering. Bakkt’s custody service benefits from $125 million of insurance coverage, providing clients with an added layer of protection. The company plans to bolster its architecture to better serve partners and institutional clients. This includes implementing automated hot wallets to enable seamless deposits and withdrawals for consumers, as well as introducing yield-generating options like staking. Bakkt remains optimistic about the future growth of its custody business and expects it to gain momentum as the year progresses.

Bakkt remains optimistic about the future growth of its custody business and expects it to gain momentum as the year progresses. Bakkt’s acquisition of Apex Crypto sets the stage for improved profitability prospects, while delistings and international expansion reflect the company’s strategic response to the evolving regulatory environment. Bakkt also aims to strengthen its crypto custody offering, enhancing its capabilities and seeking to meet the evolving needs of its partners and institutional clients.",

      "content": "Bitcoin has crossed a significant threshold this month — there are over 1 million addresses that hold at least 1 BTC. Data from Glassnode shows an escalating pattern with regard to the amount of so-called Bitcoin “wholecoiners.” If the trend continues, Bitcoin price escalation could soon make buying it not only a luxury but something potentially unattainable altogether, according to Adam Back, co-founder and CEO of Bitcoin firm Blockstream. This hyperbitcoinization refers to the moment when the benefits of Bitcoin for financial transactions will eventually lead to the replacement of established financial institutions by a public-driven system, with Bitcoin becoming the world’s default value system. FTX’s leadership is looking to claw back more than $240 million from insiders and executives that benefited from FTX’s “wildly inflated” acquisition of stock-clearing platform Embed in September. According to court filings, Embed’s own chief technology officer, Laurence Beal, was stunned that FTX paid so much for the company after one short meeting with its then-CEO, Michael Giles. Beal described FTX’s due diligence process with a cowboy emoji. Lawyers accused FTX insiders of disproportionate payouts to Embed shareholders, including $55 million paid to its CEO. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will be the first presidential candidate in United States history to accept campaign donations in Bitcoin, he announced during his first appearance as a presidential candidate at the Bitcoin 2023 conference. He praised the cryptocurrency as a “symbol of democracy and freedom” during the event. By having attended the Bitcoin event, RFK Jr. is not only targeting voters but also a potential source of millions of dollars in donations. The democratic candidate is incumbent President Joe Biden. Voyager’s bankruptcy plan was approved on May 17 and its customers could now expect to receive 35.72% of their claims initially, either in crypto via the Voyager app or in cash, after 30 days. According to Voyager, it had $1.33 billion of assets for recovery as of May 8, of which $629.8 million was available for initial recovery, on claims of $1.8 billion. If FTX/Alameda Research’s claim for preferential recovery is unsuccessful, creditors’ initial recovery could increase. For that claim, Voyager is holding back $445 million. Voyager may also be able to recover funds from bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. Cryptocurrency trading platform Coin Cafe has been ordered to repay $4.3 million to its users after allegedly charging “exorbitant and undisclosed fees” for storing Bitcoin on the platform — leading to some accounts being drained entirely of their funds. One New York investor incurred fees exceeding $10,000 in a single month, while another investor was hit with fees amounting to $51,000 over a span of 13 months, said the office of the New York State Attorney General. At the end of the week, Bitcoin ( BTC ) is at $26,889 , Ether ( ETH ) at $1,813 and XRP at $0.46 . The total market cap is at $1.13 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. Among the biggest 100 cryptocurrencies, the top three altcoin gainers of the week are Render Token (RNDR) at 29%, Conflux (CFX) at 20.52% and SingularityNET (AGIX) at 19.94%.

US debt deal to trigger $1T liquidity crunch, analyst warns Bitcoin stares down potential losses heading into the third-quarter of 2023 as U.S. lawmakers will likely reach an agreement on raising the debt ceiling. Raising the debt ceiling means the U.S. Treasury could issue new bonds to raise cash to meet its previous obligations, draining liquidity from riskier assets like Bitcoin. Such macroeconomic hurdles could prevent Bitcoin from reclaiming its yearly highs of over $30,000 in the coming months, said pseudonymous independent market analyst Income Sharks. “We most likely range between 20k to 30k and even get an altseason,” the analyst noted, adding that “new money isn’t coming in; it’s all just rotating. Unless we get a new narrative or Stocks to find a way to rally, it’s looking more likely that the U.S. elections in 2024 will be the next big catalyst.” The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has asked Grayscale Investments to pull its application for a Filecoin Trust, warning that its underlying asset, Filecoin (FIL), can be seen as a security. Grayscale initially lodged a Form 10 application with the regulator to launch an updated Filecoin Trust product in April. This week, it received a letter from the SEC warning that FIL “meets the definition of a security” under federal law and asked the firm to withdraw their application. Cybersecurity firm Kaspersky has reported an issue with fake hardware wallets impersonating major wallet firm Trezor. According to the Kaspersky team, attackers managed to access users’ crypto assets by replacing the inner firmware. The fake Trezor wallet allowed fraudsters to steal Bitcoin via a replaced microcontroller, which enabled attackers to take control of the user’s private keys. A standard set of wallet functions were provided by the fake wallet, which resembled a genuine Trezor Model T wallet. A new scam as a service called “Inferno Drainer” has reportedly stolen nearly $6 million from unsuspecting crypto users, according to Web3 scam-detecting firm Scam Sniffer. Inferno Drainer advertises that it provides ready-to-go code to scammers, allowing them to steal crypto in exchange for a 20% cut of the scammer’s crypto “loot.” The identified address was associated with over 689 phishing websites created since March 27 and had drained millions from victims on various networks, including Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon and BNB Chain.
